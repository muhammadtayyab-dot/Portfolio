Create a beautiful, dark-mode, AI-wizard-themed freelance portfolio website for Muhammad, an AI/full-stack developer from Pakistan.

Tech stack: Next.js 14+ (App Router), TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, lucide-react icons, framer-motion for animations, next-themes for dark/light mode.

Main features already planned:
- Hero section with animated tagline "Muhammad – AI Wizard & Full-Stack Freelancer"
- About section with bio (Lahore/Karachi based, building AI tools for startups/small businesses, mission to launch AI agency)
- Skills grid (LangChain, OpenAI, Next.js, Flutter, n8n, Docker, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Projects section: 3 cards
  1. AI-Powered Social Media Analyzer (scrapes X/Instagram/RSS/web → OpenAI reports)
  2. Freelance Service Marketplace (Flutter apps + web for barbers/plumbers/etc.)
  3. n8n Automation Workflows
- Services grid ($35–50/hr)
- Contact form (Formspree placeholder)

To make it look ultra-professional: add a **floating chatbot widget** in bottom-right corner that works completely offline / without any API key / without any external service.

Chatbot requirements – must be 100% client-side and free:
- Floating bubble icon (MessageCircle from lucide-react) – opens chat window on click
- Chat window: header with "Muhammad AI Assistant" + wizard icon or avatar
- Messages list (user right-aligned blue, bot left-aligned purple/neon)
- Input field + send button
- Typing indicator (three bouncing dots) for 0.8–1.5 seconds before reply
- Typewriter / streaming-like effect for bot replies (use react-type-animation or simple setInterval)
- Knowledge base: hardcoded JavaScript object or array containing Q&A pairs based on the portfolio content. At minimum include answers for:
  - who are you / about you / bio
  - what do you do / skills
  - what projects have you built / tell me about your projects
  - details about AI Social Media Analyzer
  - details about Freelance Marketplace apps
  - details about n8n automations
  - what services do you offer
  - how much do you charge / rates / pricing
  - how to hire you / contact
  - are you available for freelance / remote work
  - where are you located
  - fun / wizard themed replies for greetings like "hi", "hello", "abracadabra"
- Matching logic: simple but smart
  - keyword matching (includes, toLowerCase)
  - multiple keywords per question category
  - fallback reply: "I'm still learning new spells... but ask me about my projects, skills, services or rates! ✨"
  - optional: use fuse.js (tiny fuzzy search library) if easy to add via npm
- Animation: chat window slides up from bottom with framer-motion
- Persist chat history in localStorage (so refresh doesn't lose messages)
- Mobile friendly: chat window doesn't cover whole screen on small devices
- Accessibility: aria labels, keyboard focus

Do NOT use:
- OpenAI, Grok, any LLM API
- Vercel AI SDK
- any external embed script (ElfSight, Voiceflow, Tidio, etc.)
- any backend route (/api/...)

Only client-side React state + hardcoded knowledge.

Bonus polish:
- Greeting message from bot when chat opens: "Hello! I'm Muhammad's AI sidekick. Ask me anything about his AI projects, skills, rates or how to work together! 🪄"
- Quick reply buttons / suggestions at bottom (e.g. chips: "Projects", "Rates", "Hire", "About")
- Subtle sound or no sound
- Close button with X icon

Project structure:
- components/ChatWidget.tsx (main floating component)
- components/ChatWindow.tsx
- lib/portfolio-knowledge.ts (export const knowledge = [...] or object)
- app/layout.tsx → include ChatWidget at root level
- Use shadcn/ui Card, Button, Input, Avatar for chat UI

Install necessary dependencies if needed:
npm install framer-motion lucide-react @radix-ui/react-scroll-area react-type-animation fuse.js (optional)

Build the full portfolio first, then add & style the chatbot as the cherry on top.

Start scaffolding now – create the knowledge base first, then the chat components, then integrate into layout.
